NUMWORKS APPLICATION – UPDATE ERROR REFERENCE

This document explains all error types related to the App Update system.

  --------------------------------------------
  APPUPDATER ERRORS (Runtime Update Process)
  --------------------------------------------

These errors originate from AppUpdater.swift.

Error Code 1 – Unzip Failure Meaning: The system unzip command
(/usr/bin/unzip) failed. Cause: - Corrupted zip file - Invalid zip
file - System unzip returned non-zero exit status Effect: Update stops
before extraction is completed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error Code 2 – Invalid Zip File Meaning: The downloaded file is not
recognized as a .zip file. Cause: - The download URL did not point to a
zip asset - GitHub returned a tag page instead of the asset - File
extension mismatch Effect: Updater aborts before extraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error Code 3 – Enumerator Failure Meaning: The file system enumerator
could not scan the Downloads folder. Cause: - File system permission
issue - Unexpected failure while accessing Downloads directory Effect:
Updater cannot locate extracted app.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error Code 4 – Extracted App Not Found Meaning: After unzipping, no .app
bundle could be detected. Cause (most common): - Zip preserves original
timestamps, so detection by modification date fails - Zip does not
actually contain a .app - App bundle is nested differently than expected
Effect: Updater fails during post-unzip detection phase.

  --------------------------------------------
  APPUPDATECHECKER ERRORS (GitHub API Layer)
  --------------------------------------------

These errors originate from AppUpdateChecker.swift.

InvalidCurrentVersion Meaning: The app’s current version string
(CFBundleShortVersionString) could not be parsed as semantic version.
Cause: - Malformed version string in Info.plist

------------------------------------------------------------------------

InvalidResponse Meaning: GitHub API returned a non-2xx HTTP response.
Cause: - Network issue - GitHub rate limiting - Invalid repository
name - API unavailable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

InvalidLatestTag Meaning: The latest GitHub release tag could not be
parsed as semantic version. Cause: - Tag does not follow numeric format
(e.g., not X.Y.Z)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MissingLatestZipURL Meaning: No .zip asset was found in the latest
GitHub release. Cause: - Release does not include a zip asset - Asset
naming mismatch - Wrong repository release configuration
